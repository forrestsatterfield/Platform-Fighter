Platform Fighter Engine Full Release 1.4.2 - Patch Notes
(Last Modified: 10/16/2023)

Attacks
- Added Toon Link's Down Special.
	- This move spawns a bomb item that the user holds.
	- The bomb explodes after a certain amount of time, or if it is thrown.
	- If the bomb hits an opponent, the explosion won't damage the player who threw the bomb.
- Added Diddy Kong's Down Special.
	- This move throws a banana peel item behind the user.
	- If the banana peel hits an opponent in the air, it deals weak damage and knockback.
	- If the banana peel hits a grounded opponent, they instantly trip.
	- Other players can pick up and throw the banana.
- Added Pikachu's Up Special.
	- This move allows the user to quickly move in any direction.
	- You can optionally move a second time if you tilt the control stick in a different direction.
- General balance adjustments.

Fixes
- "stick_flick_cooldown" is now 2 frames by default, which should fix an issue with stick flicks being registered multiple times.
- "basic_item_throw" and "scalar_item_throw" no longer crash if the item is destroyed before the throw happens.
- The tumble state now uses "hitstun_grav" instead of the normal gravity value.

Extra
- The default max palette height is now 48 colors.
- The game now alerts you if you try to use a palette sprite that is larger than the max size.
- "pick_up_item" now has an argument for specifying the id of one item to be picked up.
- "hitbox_group_whitelist_id" can now be used on the "hitbox_group_array" of projectiles, if you set the "group_number" argument to "-1".
- Adjusted the volume of some sound effects.
- A small amount of folder reorganization.
- Fixed some comments.
